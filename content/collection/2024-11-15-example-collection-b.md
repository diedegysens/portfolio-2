description: "The typography assignment was to make text (in combination with
  image) as attractive and readable as possible, in function of a certain
  medium. The four media we have to work on are: a book spread, poster,
  slideshow and an instagram post. Two versions are expected for each medium,
  one with only the focus on typography and one with the combination of
  photography and image."

When I compare my final result with week 1, I see a huge difference. My designs from the first week did not focus on the essence at all and were too complex. I learned that simplicity and essence are much more attractive than all kinds of unnecessary, added things.

It was an assignment that I liked working on and wanted to keep working on. That is why I also liked to stick my posters on the wooden planks as an extra touch.
