It was certainly a challenge for me, it was an assignment for which there are very diverse outcomes and yet it was sometimes a bit difficult for me. I learned several things during the assignment, which I will certainly remember for later assignments and works. 

1. The importance of a varied layout for creating tension. 
2. First sketch out the layout on paper, even if it has changed almost completely towards the end. It makes you think properly about the structural layout instead of blindly starting in InDesign. 
3. Typography, something I was confronted with a bit too late, because of the thoughts that my chosen font was good. I should have realized it when I saw the limited family. But I will certainly not have that in the future. 
4. I certainly knew the importance of test printing, but this assignment emphasized this even more. It is a pitfall to think that it will look the same on paper as on the computer. This of course again in terms of typography, but certainly also in terms of color. 

Am I satisfied with my work? Yes, definitely. I wouldn't call it the definition of perfection, but the personal progress I have made is definitely something I can and should be proud of.
