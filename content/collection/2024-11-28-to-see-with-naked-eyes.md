description: For this assignment we had to photograph architectural elements
  with color contrasts. From these images we had to create the colors with 6
  colors of acrylic paint and represent them in a way that they are indexed to a
  certain medium.

The color would be displayed centered in the percentage in which it is present in the photo. Not like in the prototype, because it is difficult to see how much of each color is present.

I thought about how I could apply the name with a personal inspiration. I divided all the colors of all the photos into 3 categories: colors that I feel comfortable with, neutral colors to colors that make me uncomfortable. The name of each color corresponds to the feeling that comes up in me in the category in which it is located. Comfortable colors start from 01, neutral colors from 50 and uncomfortable colors from 100. The idea is that this could be supplemented by other colors. This is what the final arrangement looked like:
